# Kamino: Galactic Republic Cloners 

Kamino (pronounced `/kə'minoʊ/`) was an aquatic planet located in a remote star system in Wild Space of the galaxy. It was sometimes considered extragalactic due to being in close proximity to the Rishi Maze dwarf satellite galaxy. It was inhabited by the Kaminoans—a race of tall, elegant beings with long necks who were regarded as a mysterious species that tended to keep to themselves. They were also known for their cloning technology, which was used to create a clone army for the Galactic Republic.
